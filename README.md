# Projecting-the-USA-Pop

In this project, I take the USA's population at the year 2020 (broken down by age group) and project forward in 4 different ways:

1. In a way that assumes fertility and mortality remain the same
2. Using the current low fertility and mortality rates of South Korea
3. Using the high fertility and moderate mortality rates of Kenya 
4. Using the very high fertility and mortality rates of Niger


The goal is to see how these different fertility and mortality rates would impact A. The US's population size B. The US's long-term growth rate and C. The US's age structure.
